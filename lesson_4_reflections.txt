What would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

You may want to create a different branch, when there's more than one person working in the project and you want to add a new feature in the project, not interfering in the production code in the master branch.

You may want to work on master branch if only you are working in the project, so you can keep track of your own changes, and come backif you made a mistake.
